# This project is created with Vite and typescript

## Setup

- install node 16 or 18
- install yarn globally by running `npm i -g yarn`
- run `yarn` or `yarn install`
- run `cp .env.example .env`
- change the api base url if needed
- finally run `yarn dev`
- the project should be up by now and ready to serve on [Open Project](http://localhost:3000)

Note
---------------

There is a lot of data to render in the graphs, so it will take some time to load in graphs

- you need to install and enable this extension for now as we are getting CORS error in google chrome
